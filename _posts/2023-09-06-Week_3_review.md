## Review for Week 3 of CompSci

### Monday
Arrival into class where Mr. Mortensen calls everyone to the front of the class and begins explaining how to create tables in Markdown and HTML, and then explains how to use JavaScript in the tables. Since we are required to have a table with JavaScript, (According to Xavier) I decide to make a Chinese index since I can add to it with vocab I learn in Chinese and can experiment with the table.

### Tuesday
Moved to another class so Mr. Mortensen can teach the APCompSci classes. Messed around with Snake settings while talking to Xavier about Snake settings. Later, Mr. Mortensen came back into the room and explained what he expected of the class again, and how important planning is.
