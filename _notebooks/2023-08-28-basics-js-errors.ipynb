    "There are many changes to this code. Most of the code is new, while the rest have been modified. We'll start with the first difference that can be noted from the menu object. Originally, burger, fries, and drink variables were strings instead of actual variables, which doesn't work out when you're trying to store a value. To fix this, just remove the quotes so it's no longer a string, but an actual variable that can store values within itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see the Menu that appears is mostly the same with exception that .ToFixed(2) was removed as it served no purpose as the numbers wouldn't have gone past 2 decimal places either way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the prompts. This part was nonexistent in the original code, and it prompts the user whether or not the users wants burger, fries, and/or drinks. The user simply has to type Yes or No has directed by the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below this, the variable \"total\" is defined to have a starting value of 0. This is the same as before and it just makes sure that the user is getting a fair cost based off what they buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the code basically states if the user selected yes for the following menu items, add that to their cost. If they didn't select yes, the code will be ignored and the cost for that item will not be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last part of code outputs the cost of food in which the user bought. If they didn't buy anything, a message will appear on such. If they did buy something they will be shown their total cost which was done by concanetating a sentence with the total variable. Also note that toFixed(2) was added to the total variable as without the number would some reason output a very long decimal (this only happened if all 3 items were bought)."
