### What I did my first week at CompSci

#### Weekly results
- In the first week, Mr. Mortensen told us the plans for the study, how he would teach, what we would learn, and how to set up VScode for the work

#### Wednesday
- Mr.Mortensen explains how useful this lesson will be, and similar items. He then refers to the syllabus and the items we will be downloading, such as VSCode, Homebrew (for Mac), or WSL  (for Windows).
#### Thursday 
- The class was asked to read topics that describe instructions for installing additional programs such as Slack and additional tools to VScode. It was also suggested to find a partner for pair programming
#### Friday
- Review and test as a Pair. Spend 25 minutes at one keyboard then switch for next 25 minutes.
